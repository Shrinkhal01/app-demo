## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant purple (#9D4EDD) to reflect GitHub's developer-focused nature with a modern twist.
- Background color: Use a very light gray (#F5F3F4), almost white, to keep the interface clean and focused on the content.
- Accent color: Use a magenta (#E900FF), that is a color analogous to the purple, to highlight important actions and interactive elements.
- Employ a clean, sans-serif font for readability and a modern feel.
- Organize the follower lists in a clear, single-column layout with subtle dividers to distinguish each section.
- Incorporate a subtle fade-in effect when the follower lists are loaded to provide a smooth user experience.
